# Case Studies

Real-world applications of interpretability techniques across domains. Learn from literature examples and successful research.

## By Domain

- [Computer Vision](computer_vision/) - Image classification, object detection
- [Natural Language](natural_language/) - Language models, transformers
- [Reinforcement Learning](reinforcement_learning/) - Game-playing, robotics
- [Recurrent Networks](recurrent_networks/) - Dynamics, memory, temporal processing
- [Board Games](board_games/) - Strategic reasoning, planning
- [Neuroscience](neuroscience/) - Biological neural networks, cortical dynamics
- [Multimodal](multimodal/) - Vision-language models

## Case Study Structure

Each case study follows a standard format:

1. Task and Architecture
2. Analysis Methods Applied
3. Key Findings
4. Relevance to Broader Questions
5. Implementation Notes
6. References

## Learning from Case Studies

**For practitioners**: See how techniques are applied in practice

**For researchers**: Understand what has been tried, what worked, what remains open

**For beginners**: Build intuition through concrete examples
